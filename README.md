## About <a name = "about"></a>

This is a simple take on the classic game of tic-tac-toe. Rather than making a simple command line version of tic-tac-toe, I built a rather intuitive GUI around the game so that it is easy to play and understand.

## Getting Started <a name = "getting_started"></a>

All you need to get started is to clone this repo into any directory that you want by using the following command:

```
git clone https://github.com/AshuHK/Tic_Tac_Toe_Game.git
```

### Prerequisites

The prerequisites are rather self-explanatory and are most likely already installed on your local system:
  - Python 3.5 or above - the programming language this game was written in. Installation instructions can be found [here](https://www.python.org/downloads/)
  - Tkinter - the GUI framework used to display the game. Installation instructions can be found [here too](https://tkdocs.com/tutorial/install.html)

### Installing

After cloning the repo into, you can simply start the game using:

```zsh
python main.py
```

or

```zsh
python3.8 main.py
```
